Renting a house is popular with peoples from all around the world. Typically, students and employees that are moving temporarily will share house renting. The existing house rental system in Ethiopian Town is done through the traditional way of searching of house. The owner that wants to rent writes the vacancy (some information) about house and tag it on the door then the customer read that vacancy and contact with him for renting purpose. 
Therefore, this system tends to help landlords manage their information digitally with the aim of minimizing the risk of losing data and also helping them advertising their houses
